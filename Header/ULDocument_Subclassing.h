#pragma mark - Filename handling

/*!
 @abstract Provides the URL for save operations whenever an explicit filename is not given.
 @discussion Subclasses may override this method to perform additional filename sanitization. If specified, sanitization is allowed to reuse an existing filename if a filename collision occurs. Default implementation uses -preferredFilename for filename generation, regardless of existing filenames in the same folder.

 @abstract Notifies the subclass that the file URL of the document has been changed while auto-saving the document.
 @discuss Use this hook to determine active, user-driven filename changes. E.g. for updating external meta data stores. Default implementation does nothing. Please note that the renamed file is still coordinated during the method call.

 @abstract Immediatelly close the the document.
 @discussion All unsaved changes will be discarded. Subclasses should override this method to ensure the document is no longer usable.
