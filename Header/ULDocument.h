 @abstract The kind of save operations known to ULDocument.
 
 @const ULDocumentSave		The document was saved by explicit user action. This usually creates a new version of the document on disk. If the URL of the document changed, the document is moved.
 @const ULDocumentAutosave	The document was saved due to an implicitly triggered event, like a timer. Does not create versions. If the URL of the document changed, the document is moved.
 @const ULDocumentSaveAs	The document was saved by explicit user action to a new URL. This creates a new version of the document on disk, while the original document is kept.
 @const ULDocumentSaveTo	The document is supposed to be written to some URL by explicit user action. This is like an "Export" kind of functionality, not changing the receiving document but just writing out a copy.
